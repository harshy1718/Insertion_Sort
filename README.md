# Insertion_Sort
Insertion Sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It iterates through the array, comparing each element with the previous ones and placing it in the correct position. With a time complexity of O(n^2), it performs well on small or partially sorted arrays.
